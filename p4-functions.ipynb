    "1) Rewrite the grading program you created in the previous practice by using a function. Then use the function, called `convert_grade` to convert to letter grade every score in the list called `scores`. NB: Your function should not break when it encounters problematic scores. The original program description: write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and 1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error message. If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:\n",
